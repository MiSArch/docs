There are three ways to start the MisArch project.

1. Using prebuilt docker images (Recommended, if no code changes are necessary)
2. Rebuilding docker images (Recommended, when modifiying parts of the system)
3. Kubernetes (Recommended for tests of real-world environments)

### Docker Compose

First clone the repository for the one-click docker setup:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/MiSArch/infrastructure-docker.git
git submodule update  --recursive --init
```

#### Using prebuilt images

This approach does not reflect changes in the source code. It always starts the current (published) version of the services.

```sh
docker compose up
```

##### Building containers

Builds the containers using git submodules. This allows versioning and reflects code changes in the respective submodules.

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose-dev.yaml up
```

### Kubernetes
