# Payment Service

The payment service consists of the bounded contexts `Payment`, `PaymentInformation` and `PaymentMethod`.
It is responsible for handling the payment prozess and managing `Users` payment Infotmations. It is part of the order and return saga, where it captures the payments for `Orders` or refunds the payment after an `Return`.
It _is not a payment provider_ but simulates communicating with one via the `Simulation` Service.
