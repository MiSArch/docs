# Media Service

The media service provides the bounded context `Media`.
It is responsible for managing medias.
The media services uses a Nginx reverse proxy to make the fixed domain of MinIO pre-signed URLs configurable through environment variables.

The service parses the following environment variables:

- `MINIO_ENDPOINT`: configurable domain of the MinIO instance.
- `PATH_EXPIRATION_TIME`: validity duration of MinIO pre-signed URLs.
- `PROXY_PATH`: path to include in the pre-signed URLs.

## Domain Model

<CustomImage path="/renderedDiagrams/mediaDomainModel" width="735" height="250" />
