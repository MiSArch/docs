# Media Service

The media service provides the bounded context `Media`.
It is responsible for managing medias.
The media services uses a Nginx reverse proxy to make the fixed domain of MinIO pre-signed URLs configurable through environment variables.

A pre-signed URL is used as a reference to a specific media. It is generated for each `Media` entity when the `path` attribute is requested.
This is necessary for access control to specific media files. A `Media` entity cannot be queried by a user client directly.
It is used in within the service mesh by other services to reference medias in the services datatypes.
Pre-signed URLs link media to authenticated service datatypes, chaining authentication. Each request of the `path` attribute on `Media` generates a new pre-signed URL with a limited validity duration.

The service parses the following environment variables:

- `MINIO_ENDPOINT`: configurable domain of the MinIO instance.
- `PATH_EXPIRATION_TIME`: validity duration of MinIO pre-signed URLs in seconds. A resource can no longer be reached under the pre-signed URL after the pre-signed URL is expired.
- `PROXY_PATH`: path to include in the pre-signed URLs.
