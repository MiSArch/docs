# Simulation Service

The simulation service simulates all actions, that could not be implemented in the scope of the MisArch project.
It simulates status changes for `Payment` and `Shipment` events. Users of the reference architecture can configure the number of Events processed per Minute and Processing durations.
It is also possible, to update the event status manually for full control.

### REST API

The service provides a REST API which is used by the payment and shipping service, to register about new events to simulate. Additionally, users can query all currently queued events and manually change the status of events.

## Technology Stack
