Welcome to the MisArch project - A representable microservice reference architecture

### Project Purpose

Modern software systems often adhere to the Microservices architectural style, where applications are composed of multiple independently developed microservices.
Well-known applications following this style include Netflix and Amazon.
These individual microservices often communicate through synchronous calls (REST, GraphQL, etc.) or asynchronous calls (gRPC, messaging, etc.).
Additionally, such applications are monitored and traced using tools like Prometheus and Zipkin.
To be able to respond to constant changes in the environment, such as fluctuating workload, autoscalers are typically used to scale the individual services accordingly.

In order to test applications and concepts for such architectures, both research and industry require what are known as reference architectures.
However, existing microservice reference architectures are often not representative, as they are frequently very small and utilize outdated technologies, primarily relying on synchronous communication.
Realistic applications from the industry, on the other hand, are often not available.
Therefore, there is a need for a realistic and representative open-source microservice application.

The aim of this development project is to create such a reference architecture.
