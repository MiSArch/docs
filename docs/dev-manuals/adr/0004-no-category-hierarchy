# No category hierarchy

## Context and Problem Statement

A category hierarchy would enable better navigation of categories in the frontend.

## Considered Options

-   Category hierarchy
-   No Category hierarchy

## Decision Outcome

No Category hierarchy, simpler and good enough.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Category hierarchy

-   Good, extensive filter options
-   Neutral, hierarchy tree needs to be kept consistent
-   Bad, removing a category gets more complicated
-   Good, higher flexibility of assigning categories. Unsuitable super-categories can be avoided

### No Category hierarchy

-   Good, simpler as each category is independent of each other
-   Good, hierarchy layer could be added dynamically if required:
-   Bad, user might loose track of the category context: For example: A category bow might represent weapons or tools for the violin
